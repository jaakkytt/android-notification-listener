A simple Android app that listens to notifications from other apps and sends them to a user defined server for further processing.

![All synced](./images/screen_ok.jpg)

The Notification payload is sent to the server in format as the example below:

```json
{
    "id": "b12fcbbc3152e4e8d3af3f4561e4049fd89cf0764e2b6d18561a1b9961d92be4",
    "packageName": "com.android.systemui",
    "key": "-1|com.android.systemui|2131428972|charging_state|10044",
    "title": "Wireless charging (1 h 26 m until full)",
    "text": "42% (1 h 26 m until full)",
    "subText": "",
    "bigText": "42% (1 h 26 m until full)",
    "category": "sys",
    "time": 1749199999562
}
```

Notifications are sent as they are received, but also stored in a local database in case the server is unreachable. 
Background sync for unsynced notifications is attempted every 15 minutes, and the app will retry sending notifications until the server acknowledges them with a [200..300) HTTP status code.

Remote server URL and optional authentication token can be set in the app settings (see below for example screenshots).
